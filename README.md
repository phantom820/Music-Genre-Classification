# Music-Genre-Classification
The digital shift in the distribution of music has
presented the need for effective automated classification of large
volumes of music into various categories. In project automatic
music genre classification is performed by first identifying and
extracting representative aspects of a music piece. Subsequently
music features are tested for their significance in the task of
genre classification using mutual information gain in order to
make the feature vector compact, comprehensive and efficient.
After several off-the-shelve classifiers were used, Support Vector
Machines with a radial basis function kernel turned out to be
the best performing model achieving an accuracy of 80.80% in
classifying music pieces into 1 of 10 genres in GTZAN.
